# Indiana Jones and The Infernal Machine documentation
This is unofficial and incomplete documentation about the game file structure and modding. Any information not found here please look into [Discussions](https://github.com/Jones3D-The-Infernal-Engine/Documentation/discussions) and post any question there.

Before you begin with modding it's good to extract all game resource files.  
Please follow the instruction in [pre-mod.md](pre-mod.md) for this.

## Game level 
There are 2 types of level files:
* [NDY](ndy.md) - text based level format which can be edit in any text editor.  
The documentation for this file format can be found in [ndy.md](ndy.md)
* CND - is compact binary level format. The structure of file is similar to NDY file format.
